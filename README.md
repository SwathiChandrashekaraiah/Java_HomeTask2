Short Description:
Defined a Car class to represent cars with various attributes.
The CarListManager class is responsible for managing car data, filtering and saving car lists to different files based on the criteria.
The CarFilter interface is used to define the filtering logic when saving the cars to files.
There are three methods for saving cars based on brand, model and age, and year and price criteria. Each method calls the saveCarsToFile method with a specific filter.
We need to populate the cars list with actual car objects and then run the program to save the lists of cars to different files based on the criteria.
